When called, you should review all the progress and enhancements in [progress.md](mdc:docs/progress.md) and do the following tasks:

1: Create a new work log file in .docs/work_logs as a new file if the one for the dates in progress don't already exist
2: Take all enhancements and changes from the progress file not currently documented in our [project-index.md](mdc:.docs/project-index.md) and document them.
3: Run [git-commit.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/git-commit.mdc)
